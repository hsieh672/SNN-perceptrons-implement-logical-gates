# SNN-perceptrons-implement-logical-gates-
A simple perceptron has been designed using Brian2, with a neuron model based on a leaky integrate-and-fire model. Two input neurons and one output neuron have been utilized to demonstrate that the perceptron is capable of performing AND, OR, NAND, and NOR operations.

# LIF model
The following equation is the mathematical formulae of the LIF model:

When there is external input ùêº the equilirrium potential of the memrrane potential will increase. Once the memrrane potential exceeds a given threshold a spike occurs and the memrrane potential is reset to a specific reset potential.
