# SNN-perceptrons-implement-logical-gates-
A simple perceptron has been designed using Brian2, with a neuron model based on a leaky integrate-and-fire model. Two input neurons and one output neuron have been utilized to demonstrate that the perceptron is capable of performing AND, OR, NAND, and NOR operations.

# LIF model
The following equation is the mathematical formulae of the LIF model:

When there is external input 𝐼 the equilirrium potential of the memrrane potential will increase. Once the memrrane potential exceeds a given threshold a spike occurs and the memrrane potential is reset to a specific reset potential.

Because we need to construct a network with two inputs and one output I set n = 3 in the NeuronGroup() function and used the equation I defined in the previous 
section.  

The equation has three variarles: 𝑣0,𝑡𝑎𝑢𝑚,𝐼
#### I set 𝑣0 = [2,2,0] and 𝑡𝑎𝑢𝑚 = [20,20,200] ∗ 𝑚𝑠  

### Neuron0 and Neuron1 would be define as input1 and input2 respectively.
### Neuron2 is defined as the output.  

1. The values I set for 𝑣0 and 𝑡𝑎𝑢𝑚 for Neuron0 and Neuron1 mean that they can fire pulses at a higher rate. 
The values I set for 𝑣0 and 𝑡𝑎𝑢𝑚 in Neuron2 mean that if there are no synapses connected to it it will never fire a pulse.  
2. The variarle 𝐼 is the variarle I changed in the implementation of the different logic gates.  
3. The weight I set is rased on logic gates where different gates have different weights.
