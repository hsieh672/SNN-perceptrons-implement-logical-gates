# SNN-perceptrons-implement-logical-gates-
A simple perceptron has been designed using Brian2, with a neuron model based on a leaky integrate-and-fire model. Two input neurons and one output neuron have been utilized to demonstrate that the perceptron is capable of performing AND, OR, NAND, and NOR operations.
